			<h2>What's happening?</h2>

			<h3 id="opendataday">Open Data Day</h3>
			<p>CodeAcross Seattle coincides with International Open Data Day!</p>

			<p>Open Data Day is a gathering of citizens in cities around the world to write applications, liberate data, create visualizations and publish analyses using open public data to show support for and encourage the adoption open data policies by the world's local, regional and national governments.</p>

			<p><b><a href="http://opendataday.org/">Learn more about International Open Data Day.</a></b></p>

			<h3 id="codeacross">CodeAcross</h3>

			<p>CodeAcross 2014 is a weekend of events taking place in cities around the world. There will be events hosted simultaneously in dozens of cities all around the globe on the weekend of February 21-23, 2014. The goal of CodeAcross is to activate the Code for America network and inspire residents everywhere to get actively involved in their community.</p>
			<p>This year's theme for CodeAcross is <b>Beyond Transparency</b>. Let’s take the open government movement one step further, by focusing on not only making data open, but actionable. Join us to push the ball forward in Seattle, WA.</p>

      <h3 id="iconlocal">IconLocal Seattle</h3>

      <p>Make icons to represent Seattle neighborhoods, landmarks, city services, and more! You and others will then be able to use those icons in civic applications, data visualizations, etc.</p>
			
			<h2>Who should get involved?</h2>
			
			<p>Urbanists, Civic Hackers, Government Staff, Developers, Designers, etc. — anyone with the passion to make their city better.</p>

      <p><b><a href="https://codeforseattle.hackpad.com/CodeAcross-Seattle" target="blank">See this hackpad for all projects we'll work on & add your own!</a></b></p>

      <p>Many in-progress Code For Seattle projects will be available for you to work on: contribute to <a href="http://seattlewiki.net">the Seattle Wiki</a>, finish <a href="http://seattlefoodtrucks.herokuapp.com">a map of local food trucks</a>, work on <a href="http://github.com/willscott/geosub">a location-based event notification service</a>, contribute to <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>... the list goes on and on.</p>
      <p>Code For America has also issued a list of challenges for local communities to tackle this year:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>The Open Data Inventory Challenge</strong><br>
          <p>Perform an audit of Seattle's <a href="http://data.seattle.gov">open data portal</a>. Does Seattle make 311 requests public? Budget data? Construction permits? Code For America will provide a dataset checklist to compare against (we will publish a link when available). If a dataset is missing, how can we work with the city to open that dataset? What can be done with the city's already-open data? <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LFEwoVYWrTFM4gb9iKjMlI9n_MF7lDBeD7clsYGYbvo/edit">Details</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Open Data Policy Challenge</strong><br>
          <p>Does Seattle have an open data policy? It's important for an open data policy to exist so that civic data remains open and current. Check out <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/">the Sunlight Foundation's Open Data Policy Guidelines</a> for inspiration. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZP_qNd6Zf_AmGff3yXT91vnUlOPkXLDb6zFFH75A5h8/edit">Details</a>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>The Open Civic Data Scraper Challenge</strong><br>
          <p><a href="http://opencivicdata.org/">The Open Civic Data project</a> aims to provide common data formats and a friendly API for legislative information. Help them meet this goal by writing scrapers for civic data. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mf_7M4uiWYM0npdRpk1FxzcWBMh3jUwAIloOZCmao1k/edit">Details</a>.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>And, as always, come with your own ideas of what can be built to improve your city.</p>
