## Code for Seattle Government Partners:

We're priviledged to have worked in the past with individuals throughout
the local city, county, and state government. We actively work with:

- **[Department of Information Technology](http://www.seattle.gov/information-technology)**
- **[Seattle Police Department]**


## Code for Seattle Community Partners:

We're greatful for the ongoing support from a number of local community
organizations. Without them, code for seattle would not be what it is today.

- **[Socrata](http://socrata.com)** - They run data.seattle.gov, and many other open data portals!
- **[Impact Hub Seattle](http://www.impacthubseattle.com/)** - A coworking space for social impact, they host many of our meetups.
- **[Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/)** - The Juggernaut of the local tech scene.
- **[Accela](http://www.accela.com/)** - Civic Software & national sponsors.
