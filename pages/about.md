Open Seattle advocates for open data and civic technology projects that improve the lives of Seattle residents. We host monthly meetups where members pitch and work on projects, and build relationships between tech workers, community groups, and local government.

We meet on the fourth Wednesday of every month to discuss and work on civic tech projects, and often host other events open to the civic technology community. Join our [Meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/openseattle/) to find out about upcoming events.
