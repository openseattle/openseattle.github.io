#Attribution and Thanks
Many thanks to Jan Jorgenson for adapting the VB template for Jekyll.
Thank you so much to Code for Virginia Beach for creating the original site this template was based on, especially Bret Fisher.

#Quick Start:
Here's the comprehensive list of things you *must* do to customize your site after forking:
 * Open '_config.yml' and fill in the fields
 * Publish to GitHub pages

#More options:
Each element of the page is contained in the '_includes' directory.  You can change individual parts of the landing page if desired or if you're familiar with Jekyll you can make advanced changes.
