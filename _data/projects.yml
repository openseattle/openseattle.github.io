- name: "Northwest Harvest's Produce Portal"
  description: "The Growing Connections Produce Portal is a Fresh-to-Food Program (F2FP) initiative meant to connect growers with hunger relief agencies in an easy and straightforward way. A grower creates a listing when they have produce available for donation or for sale. A food program’s volunteer or staff can see listings in their area and respond. After claiming a listing, location and pickup details will be communicated automatically. Then, the volunteer/staff picks up the produce and delivers it to their food program! Note: The Produce Portal was originally developed at Seattle GiveCamp, thanks to a team of volunteer developers."
