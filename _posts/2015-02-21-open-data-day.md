Saturday February 21st saw coders, policy makers, government and non-profits gather at the University of Washington for an open data uncoference.

We wondered how can data be easy to find and use. Or how can we use data to make and improve decisions? How can we make it easy for everyone to participate in open data and civic technology?

Break out session discussed datasets and where to get them, what "open data" really means, privacy, and policies.
