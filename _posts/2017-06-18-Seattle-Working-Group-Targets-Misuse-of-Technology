**Seattle Working Group Targets the Misuse of Technology for Harassment and Abuse**
Emily F. Keller, Co-Lead Organizer of Open Seattle
 
Communication technologies have brought vast opportunities for professional networking, information sharing and reconnecting with old friends, while location and tracking software provide unprecedented data for understanding and improving our lives and communities. Yet these technologies also have a more sinister application, as they present a growing threat to victims of physical and emotional abuse, such as stalking, domestic violence, harassment and sexual assault. In addition, the popularity of anonymity features, the impracticality of erasing one’s digital footprint, and the prevalence of web platforms to observe and connect with a victim without defying a traditional “no-contact” order makes these attacks difficult to trace and stop.
A cross-sector group in Seattle has been working over the past year to develop shared knowledge and approaches for addressing the growing role that technology plays in emotional and physical abuse. On May 23, they held a small group panel as a soft launch for the Technology-Enabled Coercive Control Working Group. The event was held at Impact Hub Seattle and hosted by Candace Faber, Civic Technology Advocate for the City of Seattle, with food and beverages provided by the Police Foundation.
Members include the University Washington’s Tech Policy Lab, SafeCampus and Victim Advocacy Services; City of Seattle IT; the Seattle Police Department’s Victim Support Team; the Washington State Coalition to End Domestic Violence; the King County Coalition Ending Gender-Based Violence; and New Beginnings, a Seattle-based organization that provides services for survivors of domestic violence, including emotional abuse. 
Speakers explained how communication and anonymity tools designed to protect privacy and streamline connectivity are also used for harassment and stalking. Textfree and TextNow apps provide free calling and texting via any WiFi device using a random phone number, allowing callers to hide their identity. The software Tor, which protects Internet users from surveillance, can mask an abuser’s IP address. The FlexiSPY iPhone Tracker, which enables customers to encrypt and save messages, browsing history and GPS locations of another person – such as children or employees in dangerous situations – can be used to intercept calls, send SMS messages, or open a phone’s microphone or camera to take photos remotely. Keystroke monitoring software such as Revealer Keylogger, which is useful for IT and user testing purposes, can be installed on a victim’s device without their knowledge to steal their passwords and read their conversations.
Spoofing apps such as SpoofCard and Bluff My Call, which can disguise a caller’s phone number and voice (with the choice of “man” or “woman”), record conversations and send calls directly to voicemail, are marketed as a privacy protection tool for callers. For example, a doctor can respond to a patient from home while displaying their office phone number. However, when used for malicious purposes, proving the identity of a caller is a challenge even when the victim recognizes personal references in the content. “Sometimes judges don’t understand the technology or the context of why it’s so offensive to a victim,” said Summer Rosa-Mullen, Seattle City Attorney’s Office. Failure to intervene in electronic harassment can lead to escalating behaviors, such as an abuser showing up at a victim’s home.
 
**Case Studies of Abuse, and Challenges for Law Enforcement**
As technology-enabled abuse becomes more prevalent, law enforcement faces challenges in confronting the threat, explained Faber, organizer of the TECC working group. For example, there are questions around how courts should accept and verify digital evidence, such as whether photos of a computer screen or screen shots are sufficient.
Detective Ginger Banyai-Riepl of the UW Police Department cited a case of an abuser using impersonation to solicit intimate photos of a person, and then threatening to circulate the photos in an act of extortion. The abuser then posted the photos to a dating website, claiming to be the victim, which resulted in additional harassment from third parties. (A similar spoofing case in New York resulted in a lawsuit against the dating app Grindr). Indicative of the complexity of technologically enhanced crimes, the police initially mistook the victim for the suspect. Police then advised the victim to quit Facebook and change his phone number, but this was insufficient in stopping the abuse. The TECC working group is seeking solutions that do not put the onus on the victim to withdraw from their digital life, which is often impractical and can cause isolation.
High tech skills are not required to perpetuate technology-enabled abuse. For example, abusers can utilize social media or online contacts lists to create nonconsensual pornography and revenge porn. Accessing networking profiles through mutual contacts or impersonation, attackers can send real or edited images (sometimes placing a victim’s head on another person’s body) to the victim’s friends, family or colleagues without their consent. The ease of viewing Facebook friend lists after phone numbers are exchanged exacerbates this threat.
Angella D. Coker, Community Victim Liaison at the Washington State Department of Corrections, described a case showing how even low tech tools without anonymity features can be used to harass victims online. This included an abuser posting on his Facebook page a 911 transcript and quotes and songs from his former relationship with the victim, in addition to contacting her family members. This created a legal loophole, as it did not violate a no-contact order already in place.
Dana Cuomo, a victim advocate at UW, presented a research proposal for developing in-depth case studies of victims’ experiences and examining the resolutions provided. The proposal was created with researchers at the UW Tech Policy Lab, an interdisciplinary unit that provides educational research to improve technology policy. The project aims to provide educational information to law enforcement, judicial offices and businesses’ human resources departments to improve their response and ability to act as an “on-ramp” in pursuing earlier remedies.
Victims of technology-enabled abuse can contact the Cyber Civil Rights Legal Project, which provides pro bono representation globally.
 
**Technological Tools for Combating Abuse**
While TECC seeks to disrupt the use of technology to perpetuate abuse, the working group is also exploring the use of technical tools and design features that help to prevent or catch abusive behaviors.
UW Informatics students John Diego, Huy Nguyen, Christy Pham and Marika Rundle presented their capstone project, Bloom, which provides a confidential forum for survivors of sexual assault, human trafficking and domestic violence. Created in partnership with the local nonprofit API Chaya, Bloom allows users to generate and rearrange text and photos that share their stories to facilitate healing.
Designing safe spaces in virtual reality was the topic of a presentation by Renee Gittins, CEO and Creative Director at Stumbling Cat and a virtual reality advocate. Gittins discussed the importance of empowering users to avoid unwanted touch in programs where interactive experiences using realistic features in sound and sight can have deeply emotional consequences. She recommends creating personal moderation tools that mute players who engage in harassment (or make them invisible), and bubbles that prevent unwanted contact with another player’s virtual body; as well as platform and community moderation to prevent and respond to abuse.
There is an emerging volunteer role for people with technical expertise who want to use their skills to support survivors. Nathan Florea, Senior Software Engineer at Valassis, discussed the TechAdvocates program that is being formed to provide tech support to victims through partnerships with direct service organizations. This will require background checks and training for those without social work experience. Florea noted a few questions remain for which legal advice would be welcome: “Could a tech advocate be subpoenaed? How do you preserve evidence and not just delete it?”
Personal security apps such as Digital Witness facilitate quick outreach to pre-selected individuals and authorities in response to a threat, sending photos and GPS locations through the click of a “Help” button. Cuomo also asked the question: Could technology ease the burden on victims of repeatedly documenting technologically enabled abusive behavior?
